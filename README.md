# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7: Employees Database with SQL

## Overview
We need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, we need to write a report that summarizes our analysis and help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “__Silver Tsunami__” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Process
1. Create ERD
2. Create Database and tables
3. Import data from the provided CSV files
4. Create a table containing the number of employees retiring by title
5. Create a table containing all employees that are eligible for a mentorship program
6. Write our report

## Resources
* Data Source: 6 csv files containing all necessary data
* Language:
  - SQL (PostgreSQL), version 14

* Development tools: 
  - pgAdmin 6.1
  - Visual Code 1.62.3; just to edit README.md file.


## Analysys
* There are __300,024__ employees currently working at __*Pewlett Hackard*__.
* About __30%__ (90,398) of the employees are ready to retire.
* There are __1,549__ employees available for the mentorship program, clearly indicating that __*Pewlett Hackard*__ does not have enough internal candidates to fill vancant positions if all employees decide to retire.
* The most affected departments are:
    - __Development__ with 18,368
    - __Production__ with 16,172
    - __Sales__ with 11,336
* The most affected roles are:
    - __Senior Engineer__ with 25,916 employees about to retire.
    - __Senior Staff__ with 24,926 employees about to retire.
* A more detailed analysis would help to set an schedule to determine when these employees will be retiring so a hiring program could be started.
